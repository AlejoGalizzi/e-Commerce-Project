Welcome to my e-Commerce page.

The database originaly is empty but you could load 100 rows with the script located in the backend folder.

Step to load the rows: 

1 - Open with your graphic interface (in my case MySQL Workbench) the script located in: BackEnd\src\main\resources\static\ .
2 - Run the entire script.

The web page is dinamic, so if you want to add categories or products on the database, it will be automatically updated into the web page.
