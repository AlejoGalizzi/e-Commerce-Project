Welcome to my e-Commerce page.

The web app originaly is empty but you could load 100 rows with the script located in the backend folder.

Step to load the rows: 

1 - Open with your graphic interface (in my case MySQL Workbench) the script located in: BackEnd\src\main\resources\static\ .
2 - Run the lines 4,5 and 6 on the script.
3 - Run spring-boot server using your IDE.
4 - Run the rest of the lines on the script. Then you are going to have 100 products sorted in 4 categories.

The web page is dinamic, so if you want to add categories or products to the database, it will be automatically updated on the web page.
